      - name: 'Board State Representation'
        points:
          - header: 'Life Tracking'
            body: "Players should track life totals using a transparent and unambiguous method. Pen and paper are recommended as they provide a history of changes, allowing for easy verification. It's crucial to openly communicate with your opponent about life changes, and players should periodically cross-check totals to ensure consistency."
          - header: 'Token Representation'
            body: 'Tokens should be represented by suitable markers or placeholders. Whether using official token cards, card-sized indicators, or distinct objects, they must clearly depict the type, power/toughness, and any status (e.g., tapped/untapped) or effects.'
          - header: 'Commander Placement'
            body: "When your commander isn't in play, place it distinctly outside your main play mat area, such as above your deck or next to your life total tracker. This distinction ensures all players know its current status."
          - header: 'Commander Tax Tracking'
            body: "Use visible methods like dice or written markers to indicate the additional mana cost (tax) required for recasting a commander. Update this tax marker consistently upon each recast and ensure it's prominently visible to all players."

      - name: 'Gameplay Integrity and Best Practices'
        points:
          - header: 'Deck Handling & Cutting'
            body: 'After shuffling your deck, present it to your opponent to cut. The opponent may choose to cut or shuffle the deck lightly. This is a trust-building exercise and a method to ensure fairness in deck randomization.'
          - header: 'Board Organization'
            body: 'Maintain a clear and organized board state. Group creatures, artifacts, enchantments, and other permanents separately so both players can quickly assess the state of the game.'
          - header: 'Missed Triggers'
            body: "If a player forgets a trigger, it's considered missed. For fairness, if the game has progressed beyond the point where the trigger should've been applied, it cannot be retroactively added. The only exception is if all involved players unanimously agree to allow it."
          - header: 'Taking Back Moves'
            body: "Actions in the game are considered final. To prevent misunderstandings and misplays, players are encouraged to verbally communicate their intentions before executing a move. Using phrases like 'I'm considering...' or 'My intention is to...' provides clarity and minimizes potential disputes."
          - header: 'Game Discrepancies'
            body: "Should there be any dispute or confusion regarding the game state, turn order, or any actions taken, it's imperative to approach the matter calmly. The primary goal should be to revert to the most recent mutually agreed-upon state. If players can't come to a consensus, they should seek an impartial ruling from a designated referee or league official."

            body: 'Our community thrives on its diverse tapestry. Any form of discrimination, hate speech, or prejudice goes against our core values and is strictly prohibited.'

          - header: 'Table Politics:'
            body: "While utilizing politics in your strategy is an accepted part of the game, it's important to maintain a sense of sportsmanship. Excessive or aggressive political maneuvering can detract from the enjoyment of others. Always remember, a game should be fun for everyone at the table. Keep politics in check and approach them with a spirit of fairness and camaraderie."

          - header: 'Food and Drinks:'
            body: "Enjoy your snacks responsibly. Ensure they're kept away from play areas, use closed containers, and be prompt in addressing any mishaps."

          - header: 'Personal Hygiene:'
            body: "As close-quarter games, MTG duels require participants to uphold good personal hygiene, ensuring everyone's comfort."
