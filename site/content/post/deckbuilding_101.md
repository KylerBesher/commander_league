Embarking on the Commander journey in MTG is a unique experience. With each deck led by a legendary creature and constituted of 100 individual cards, Commander provides a platform where storytelling, strategy, and unexpected twists intertwine. This [week](/blog-commander101), we'll **navigate** through the nuances of crafting a Commander deck that embodies your gameplay identity and resonates in multiplayer skirmishes.

At the heart of every Commander deck is the Commander – a legendary creature that not only provides a color identity but also often outlines your overarching strategy and objectives.

## Fundamental Aspects of Commander Deck Building

While there's room for creativity, there are core principles in Commander deck construction to ensure its viability in diverse, multiplayer scenarios:

**Mana Base**: Given the 100-card deck and the singleton rule (only one copy of any card, except basic lands), a reliable mana base is pivotal. Consider 35-40 lands, adjusting based on your deck's curve.

**Ramp**: Essential for getting ahead and casting impactful spells. Include about 10-12 ramp cards.

**Card Advantage**: Keeping a healthy hand size is crucial. Incorporate 8-10 card draw or advantage spells.

**Removal**: Equip your deck with 5-7 targeted removal spells and 3-5 board wipes. This ensures you can handle varied threats.

**Creature Base**: Depending on your strategy, aim for about 25-30 creatures. This can vary depending on whether you're more control-oriented or creature-heavy.

**Strategy and Synergy**: Beyond just powerful cards, seek out synergies and themes that resonate with your Commander and your desired playstyle.

**Flexibility and Adaptability**: Ensure your deck can pivot based on different game states or threats. Having versatile cards is key in a multiplayer format.

**Social Factor**: Commander is deeply social. Consider cards that promote interaction, negotiation, or even light-hearted banter.

The beauty of Commander is in its vastness. With an immense card pool and only a select few bans, the deck-building possibilities are truly boundless. Whether you lean competitive or casual, always remember the core ethos of Commander – enjoying the game and the shared moments with fellow players.
